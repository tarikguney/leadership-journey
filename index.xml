Working hard on the right things is indeed tremendously important. But there is one more critical ingredient in this recipe.
I write a lot, but not much on what I am about to type. I am writing up this hoping to influence people in the right direction to succeed.
The other critical ingredient to success: Working with/for great bosses.</description></item><item><title>Criticizing the Past Decisions</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/criticizing-the-past-decisions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 23:40:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/criticizing-the-past-decisions/</guid><description>When it comes to criticizing past decisions, perhaps one of the most common mistakes is to criticize them with today&amp;rsquo;s standards and realities and blame them for our troubles today with this mindset.
This also happens in the software development world. Often, we, the software engineers are passionate people in our craft. When you are passionate about something, your elevated emotions make it easier to criticize past decisions within the atmosphere of today&amp;rsquo;s advancements and requirements.</description></item><item><title>Embrace Your Vulnerabilities</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/embrace-your-vulnerabilities/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 23:39:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/embrace-your-vulnerabilities/</guid><description>Embracing your vulnerabilities is not turning them into a drama but finding the strength in them to push forward after realizing how much you still have accomplished despite your weaknesses.
Embracing other people’s vulnerabilities is learning to accept people as they are sometimes. We all are fighting our demons.</description></item><item><title>Learning How to Ask Questions</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/learning-how-to-ask-questions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 23:38:08 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/learning-how-to-ask-questions/</guid><description>Every manager’s lifelong learning is and should be asking more right questions. Nothing helps as much as questions do.
Judge them by the questions they ask, not the answer they give. Questions not just lead to solutions; they also reveal what’s being done so far, which is critical for managers to debug their teams.
Answers can change depending on many parameters. What worked for a manager before might not work for them now.</description></item><item><title>Work Smart</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/work-smart/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/work-smart/</guid><description>As a manager, focusing on too many things means nothing will get done. One thing at a time is faster than ten things at once but half done.
Focus on the things you can change first. Hard work fixes everything is a myth if you don&amp;rsquo;t work smart. Otherwise, you will only keep wasting your energy while increasing your frustration.
Don&amp;rsquo;t take action because it feels safe. Take action because it is the right thing to do.</description></item><item><title>Your Primary Team as a Manager</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/your-primary-team-as-a-manager/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/your-primary-team-as-a-manager/</guid><description>Your primary team is where you can speak freely and be who you are and can learn a lot for your career. That&amp;rsquo;s why a manager’s primary team is not the one they manage but the one they report to the same manager. And that&amp;rsquo;s fine. Your direct reports already have a lot of people to hang out with.
When you manage a team, every word that comes out of your mouth counts; even thinking out loud can cause confusion and sometimes frustration.</description></item><item><title>Emotional Maturity</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/emotional-maturity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/emotional-maturity/</guid><description>The number one leadership trait is emotional maturity.
The easiest way to stay emotionally mature is through curiosity.
Because curiosity leads to a growth mindset.
The growth mindset sees every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than something to be mad about. (Yes, sometimes you need to be angry about things!)
The faster way to develop a growth mindset is to be willing to experiment rather than push back as the initial reaction by default.</description></item><item><title>Be Better to Increase Motivation</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/be-better-to-increase-motivation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/be-better-to-increase-motivation/</guid><description>When your motivation at work drops, before making any drastic changes, check the following fail-forward strategies. They have always worked for me!
Check if you lack domain expertise and spend time learning the product better. The lack of product knowledge often narrows your perspective on your work and its impact. When you know less, you participate less in meetings; you generate fewer ideas, which could lead to thoughts that involve worthlessness, imposter syndrome, and so on.</description></item><item><title>How to Get Quality Feedback</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/how-to-get-quality-feedback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/how-to-get-quality-feedback/</guid><description>If we want quality feedback, we must know to be vulnerable.
If we want to give quality feedback to our teams, we need to prepare a space for them to feel comfortable with being vulnerable.
Feedback is a two-way street. Without sharing our stories, whether failures or successes, we cannot get quality feedback that truly helps.
And we cannot give quality feedback if we don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about the person in front of us.</description></item><item><title>Leaders Must Listen</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/leaders-must-listen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/leaders-must-listen/</guid><description>Leaders must show patience to listen. While dominating every meeting doesn’t strengthen your authority, listening to others does not undermine it.
Meetings, especially the 1:1s, are not places to dictate your ideas breathlessly.
You must have meaningful dialogues with your peers and reports to find the truth and more innovative solutions.
Breathless leaders are quick to form their impressions about people and events, and they never spend time to confirm them.</description></item><item><title>Managers Need Emotional Maturity</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/managers-need-emotional-maturity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/managers-need-emotional-maturity/</guid><description>Emotional maturity is essential for a successful management career.
Vulnerability and emotional maturity are not mutually exclusive.
Emotional maturity is not to be a ghoul.
Emotional maturity is:
Not to be overly sensitive to events. To think before reacting. To stay calm and attentive. To see the world more objectively than through our elevated emotions. Not to confuse directness and honesty with being disrespectful. To be less self-centric and more outcome-oriented.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Work Is Better</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/hybrid-work-is-better/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/hybrid-work-is-better/</guid><description>Office and remote work have different strengths, and combining them brings out the best solution.
Working from home means more focus time, less commute, and more flexibility in personal matters.
More focus can undoubtedly improve productivity if your only measure is to count the lines of code you deliver.
Engineering is more than programming, and it needs more than just more focus time for productivity.
Long-term investments can improve short-term results, such as our code throughput.</description></item><item><title>Democratization of Decision Making</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/democratization-of-decision-making/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/democratization-of-decision-making/</guid><description>Democratization of decision-making is not the same as the democratization of discussions. And often, we need just the latter.
Usually, the reason why collaborations fail is that there are too many decision-makers present. And people think discussing a matter gives them the right to decide the action. It might, but not in an ideal scenario.
Always have one final decision maker if the action is to make a decision. It does not have to be you, but whoever has the most knowledge and can see beyond.</description></item><item><title>Trust</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/trust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/trust/</guid><description>Trust can be many things, two of which are to trust people&amp;rsquo;s competency and honesty.
Honesty and competency are two different things even though they might have some overlapping areas. This distinction matters when you work with someone. They can be an honest person, but they might not possess the required skills to do a job well done.
The same applies to competent but dishonest people.
You need both of them in the same person if you are willing to work with them.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Self Improvement</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/systematic-self-improvement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/systematic-self-improvement/</guid><description>Things won&amp;rsquo;t change for the better on their own until you do something about it. It never did in my own life.
Systematic self-improving is essential to attract opportunities to yourself and recognize them when they knock on your door. When you accept them, it is the same systematic self-improvement that will help you to complete the journey successfully until the next one comes around.
Perhaps it is not this simple all the time, but for the majority of us, the formula is this simple.</description></item><item><title>Seek The Third Option</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/seek-the-third-option/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/seek-the-third-option/</guid><description>When you decide between two options, see if there is a third one! And most of the time, that&amp;rsquo;s the correct answer.
Clean code or not? Enough clean code&amp;hellip;
Do this or not? Do it and fail fast&amp;hellip;
Questions frame our way of thinking. When we are presented with only two questions, always check if another question is to be asked. And you will be surprised at what doors the new question opens in your head.</description></item><item><title>Output vs. Outcome Oriented Mindset</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/output-vs-outcome-oriented-mindset/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/output-vs-outcome-oriented-mindset/</guid><description>If you are having difficulty pivoting your teams, it could also mean an output-oriented mentality is dominant among people. It is time to think in terms of outcomes with your teams.
How are they different? Simple: If you are solely focused on your deliverables, it is output-focused thinking as deliveries being your output.
If you are focused on how you make a difference in your customer&amp;rsquo;s life, the difference is the outcome; hence, outcome-oriented thinking.</description></item><item><title>Humility, Not Incompetence</title><link>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/humility-not-incompetence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.leadershipjourney.io/posts/humility-not-incompetence/</guid><description>Some people confuse respect and humility shown to them with incompetence.
How can you tell if you are on the receiving end of this confused treatment? Several:
They never ask you for your opinion. They don&amp;rsquo;t answer you in a reasonable amount of time or at all, even if it&amp;rsquo;s their job or you built a relationship with them initially. They interrupt you constantly as they cannot show patience to listen to what you have to say.</description></item></channel></rss>
