Things won't change for the better on their own until you do something about it. It never did in my own life.

Systematic self-improving is essential to attract opportunities to yourself and recognize them when they knock on your door. When you accept them, it is the same systematic self-improvement that will help you to complete the journey successfully until the next one comes around.

Perhaps it is not this simple all the time, but for the majority of us, the formula is this simple.

Wishful thinking is fun when we vent to our friends. We feel a sense of satisfaction when talking about how unfair life is, especially if our friends are sharing the same fate as we do.

And we can ignore the power of even the simplest of steps toward change. But again, this is not just about desiring change. It needs action one way or another. To me, thinking about compelling questions are a great start. And they are the simplest of the advancing actions.

What do I want? Where could I have been? What do I need to do to get there? Who can help me? What can help me?

Some people confuse this with greed. But unlike the confused, these people don't run after their desires. They just consistently walk toward their targets and take their time. They talk about their goals with others, but compared to their time for other interests, these conversations don't even take up 1% of their daily time.

It is interesting how it can be seen as greed when you want something with 1% of your time. Greed is not wanting something and working on getting it. It is whether you are destroying your and others' lives to get it.

Perhaps for many of us, what we were not given is not money or prestigious education. It is actually how to ask... Asking ourselves the right yet simple questions could have changed a lot of things in our lives.

Replace "I can not do it" with "How can I do it?"
Replace "I cannot afford it" with "How can I afford it?"
Replace "I am not smart" with "How can I learn that?"
Replace "I am not happy" with "How can I be happy?"

You may be surprised at how simple some answers are...
