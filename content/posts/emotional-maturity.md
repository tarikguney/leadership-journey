The number one leadership trait is emotional maturity.

The easiest way to stay emotionally mature is through curiosity.

Because curiosity leads to a growth mindset.

The growth mindset sees every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than something to be mad about. (Yes, sometimes you need to be angry about things!)

The faster way to develop a growth mindset is to be willing to experiment rather than push back as the initial reaction by default.

Pushback is often a result of attempting to predict how a decision will result based on our experience, which is, in reality, often a lot harder than it looks.

More times than not, we have the time and resources to experiment. But predicting the future, however wrong it is, is much easier for us. Let alone how overconfident we often are in ourselves.

In short, to stay emotionally mature, be willing to experiment and be ready to disconfirm your ideas.

Maturity does not often need years of dealing with life problems to develop.
