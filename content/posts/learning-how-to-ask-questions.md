Every manager’s lifelong learning is and should be asking more right questions. Nothing helps as much as questions do.

Judge them by the questions they ask, not the answer they give. Questions not just lead to solutions; they also reveal what’s being done so far, which is critical for managers to debug their teams.

Answers can change depending on many parameters. What worked for a manager before might not work for them now.

The only way to understand the best path forward is by means of asking the right questions.
