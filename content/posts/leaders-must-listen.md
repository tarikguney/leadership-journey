Leaders must show patience to listen. While dominating every meeting doesnâ€™t strengthen your authority, listening to others does not undermine it.

Meetings, especially the 1:1s, are not places to dictate your ideas breathlessly.

You must have meaningful dialogues with your peers and reports to find the truth and more innovative solutions.

Breathless leaders are quick to form their impressions about people and events, and they never spend time to confirm them.

When they act on their unverified beliefs, they cause constant churns among teams.
