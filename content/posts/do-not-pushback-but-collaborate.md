When pushing back, people often put hard limits. For some rare cases or specific situations, pushing back on the ask is acceptable, such as being expected for 15 hours every single day or changing the priorities very often to block the team from delivering anything.

But sometimes, people can find themselves in a pushback loop to the point of losing opportunities to keep what they think is better. Pushback loops might even lead to severe consequences as working with those people gets harder and harder. 

You can see if someone is stuck in their pushback loop if they constantly find a reason not to change their work even though they could benefit immensely from the proposed idea. The problem is that though they are usually too stuck in their narratives, they don't even consider what's really being asked. They can constantly give conflicting messages, and you find yourself in rhetorical discussions for hours, which often don't address the actual point.

They can also start hurting other people's professional development by negatively influencing them constantly by promoting a pushback culture.

The better alternative is collaboration to work closely and positively with people, understand their reasons, and see if it can be prioritized and worked out for the better. Collaboration leads to a more positive experience for everyone. It needs humility, respect, intentions to listen carefully, willingness to understand truly, and of course, a strong sense of experimenting. 

If you see someone who says no or gives reasons that effectively say "no" without showing any attempts to understand the reasons behind it, then you have one of those negative pusbackers on your team. 

Often, you coach them. If they are unwilling to be coached, the final solution is to transfer them out of your teams as soon as possible.
