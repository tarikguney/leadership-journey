As a manager, focusing on too many things means nothing will get done. One thing at a time is faster than ten things at once but half done.

Focus on the things you can change first. Hard work fixes everything is a myth if you don't work smart. Otherwise, you will only keep wasting your energy while increasing your frustration.

Don't take action because it feels safe. Take action because it is the right thing to do. And as a manager, what's right is to develop your people and make long-term investments. Feedback, good process, clear expectations, hiring and building talent, etc., are long-term investments.

When you want to help your team, see what you can do that they can't. For example, find other teams outside that can help. Connect them to the right people. Get their questions answered. Support them through their journey.

Do you want to improve your product? Improve the communication, expectations, culture, and direction first.

Say less, actively listen more. It is okay to ask. You are not meant to know everything. But you are meant to ask and learn.
