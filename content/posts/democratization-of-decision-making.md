Democratization of decision-making is not the same as the democratization of discussions. And often, we need just the latter.

Usually, the reason why collaborations fail is that there are too many decision-makers present. And people think discussing a matter gives them the right to decide the action. It might, but not in an ideal scenario.

Always have one final decision maker if the action is to make a decision. It does not have to be you, but whoever has the most knowledge and can see beyond. It is the first step for collaborations to succeed.
