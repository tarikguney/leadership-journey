If we want quality feedback, we must know to be vulnerable.

If we want to give quality feedback to our teams, we need to prepare a space for them to feel comfortable with being vulnerable.

Feedback is a two-way street. Without sharing our stories, whether failures or successes, we cannot get quality feedback that truly helps.

And we cannot give quality feedback if we don't know enough about the person in front of us.

There lies vulnerability at the intersection of giving and taking feedback.

Vulnerability is not to create drama around weaknesses.

Vulnerability is knowing that we can fail sometimes regardless of how passionate and thorough we are. And it is okay to talk about our failures to get better.

If admitting your mistakes is not helping you to get better but even making everything worse, then don't stop being vulnerable, but stop showing your vulnerability to the wrong people.
