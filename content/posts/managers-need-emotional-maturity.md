Emotional maturity is essential for a successful management career.

Vulnerability and emotional maturity are not mutually exclusive.

Emotional maturity is not to be a ghoul.

Emotional maturity is:

1. Not to be overly sensitive to events.
2. To think before reacting.
3. To stay calm and attentive.
4. To see the world more objectively than through our elevated emotions.
5. Not to confuse directness and honesty with being disrespectful.
6. To be less self-centric and more outcome-oriented.
7. Not to exaggerate the impact of events more than they actually are.
