When your motivation at work drops, before making any drastic changes, check the following fail-forward strategies. They have always worked for me!

1. Check if you lack domain expertise and spend time learning the product better. The lack of product knowledge often narrows your perspective on your work and its impact. When you know less, you participate less in meetings; you generate fewer ideas, which could lead to thoughts that involve worthlessness, imposter syndrome, and so on.

2. Check if you can improve your efficiency in doing your work. Lack of efficiency can result in overwhelming struggles with your tasks. You enjoy your work progressively less because of this constant struggle. Also, when you are efficient, your credibility at work will increase, which often builds more satisfying relations with others as they will consult your ideas more.
