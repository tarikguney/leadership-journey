When you decide between two options, see if there is a third one! And most of the time, that's the correct answer.

Clean code or not? Enough clean code...

Do this or not? Do it and fail fast...

Questions frame our way of thinking. When we are presented with only two questions, always check if another question is to be asked. And you will be surprised at what doors the new question opens in your head.

The third choice comes in different flavors. Sometimes, it is the “why” question.

Shall we hire them or not? Why do we need to hire for this position? How else can we meet the need here?

Sometimes you invert the question.

What happens if we don't hire anyone? Is this too big of a loss? Can we hire later?

Sometimes it is the middle ground rather than the two ends of a binary decision.

Let's not rush it and keep our options open while actively looking for someone for this position.

Enough clean code instead of clean code or not.

Lots of examples can be given.

But whatever you do, look for a third option by default!
