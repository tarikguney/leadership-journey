Trust can be many things, two of which are to trust people's competency and honesty.

Honesty and competency are two different things even though they might have some overlapping areas. This distinction matters when you work with someone. They can be an honest person, but they might not possess the required skills to do a job well done.

The same applies to competent but dishonest people.

You need both of them in the same person if you are willing to work with them.
